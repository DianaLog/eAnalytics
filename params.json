  "body": "# Features\r\n* Profile: take an overview of the industry\r\n* Performance: measure key performance indicators (KPIs)\r\n* Trends: identify changes in the industry over time\r\n* Explorer: discover new relationships in the data\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\neAnalytics is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) web application built on top of [R](https://www.r-project.org) for energy-related data analytics. The app is powered by the excellent [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/), [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and [googleVis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/vignettes/googleVis_examples.html) packages. To learn more about our project, see this [publication](http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/9780784413012.143).\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nTo install eAnalytics in R:\r\n\r\n```S\r\ninstall.packages(\"eAnalytics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr to install the latest developmental version:\r\n\r\n```S\r\ndevtools::install_github('paulgovan/eAnalytics')\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo launch the app:\r\n\r\n```S\r\neAnalytics()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr to access the app through a browser, visit [paulgovan.shinyapps.io/eAnalytics](https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/eAnalytics).\r\n\r\n# Data\r\neAnalytics is built around the [energyr](https://github.com/paulgovan/energyr) R package of data published by the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [www.ferc.gov](www.ferc.gov). energyr contains several datasets for different industry segments:\r\n\r\n* `electric`: Electric Company Financial Data\r\n* `gas`: Natural Gas Company Financial Data\r\n* `hydropower`: Hydropower Plant Data\r\n* `lng`: LNG Plant Data\r\n* `oil`: Oil Company Financial Data\r\n* `pipeline`: Natural Gas Pipeline Project Data\r\n* `storage`: Natural Gas Storage Field Data\r\n\r\n# Tutorial\r\n\r\n## Dashboard\r\nLaunching the app first brings up the Dashboard tab, which is basically a landing page that gives a brief introduction to the app and includes three value boxes for the current number of projects, companies, and facilities in the database. \r\n\r\n![Dashboard](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/blob/master/inst/images/Dashboard.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Profile\r\nThe Profile tab contains a number of interactive maps with information about facilities for the selected industry. The figure below shows the Profile tab for the Natural Gas Industry.\r\n\r\nMultiple options are currently available for customizing the maps. Choose a preferred size or color variable in the movable well panel, select from different basemaps via the lower-right control, and click on a specific facility to view additional information.\r\n\r\n![Profile](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/blob/master/inst/images/Profile2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\nThe Performance tab tracks a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the selected industry. The following figure shows the Performance tab for the Natural Gas Industry.\r\n\r\n![Performance](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/blob/master/inst/images/Performance2.png?raw=true) \r\n\r\n## Trends\r\n\r\nThe Trends tab contains multiple interactive time-series charts of financial information for the selected industry. The following figure shows the Performance tab for the Electric industry.\r\n\r\nThe time-series chart in the Trends tab is linked to the data table shown in the Data tab. Searching, filtering, and sorting the data in the data table will automatically update the time-series chart with the selected data.\r\n\r\n![Trends](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/blob/master/inst/images/Trends2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Data \r\nThe Data tab contains interactive datatables of information for the selected industry. The data can be searched, filtered, and sorted as required. The selected data can then be copied to the clipboard, downloaded to a csv or pdf file, or sent to a local printer. The figure below shows the Data tab for the Hydropower industry.\r\n\r\n![Data](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/blob/master/inst/images/Data.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Explorer\r\nThe Explorer tab contains a dynamic motion chart for exploring several indicators over time. The following figure shows the Explorer tab for the Natural Gas Industry.\r\n\r\n![Explorer2](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/blob/master/inst/images/Explorer2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n# Source Code\r\neAnalytics is an [open source](http://opensource.org) project, and the source code and project data is available at [https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics)\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\nFor issues or requests, please use the GitHub issue tracker at [https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/issues](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/issues)\r\n\r\n# Contributions\r\nCcontributions are welcome by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/paulgovan/eAnalytics/pulls)\r\n\r\n# License\r\neAnalytics is licensed under the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) licence. &copy; Paul Govan (2015)\r\n",
